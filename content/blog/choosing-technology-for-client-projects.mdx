# How I Choose Technology for Client Projects (And When I Say No)

One of the biggest fears founders have isn’t development speed.  
It’s **making the wrong technical decision early** and paying for it later.

This article explains how I choose technology for client projects — and just as importantly, **when I deliberately say no**.

Not because I can’t build something, but because I’m protecting the product.

## Why “Latest Tech” Is Often a Mistake

New tools are exciting.  
But excitement is not a business requirement.

In real projects, choosing the latest framework often leads to:

- Smaller talent pool
- Immature ecosystems
- Unexpected edge cases
- Higher maintenance cost
- Slower onboarding for future developers

That doesn’t mean new tech is bad — it means **context matters**.

Technology should reduce risk, not introduce it.

## How Project Stage Affects Tech Choice

I don’t choose tech in isolation.  
I choose it based on **where the product is right now**.

### Early-stage / MVP
- Speed matters
- Clarity matters
- Simplicity wins
- Proven tools are safer

### Growth-stage
- Performance starts to matter
- Structure and scalability matter
- Observability and maintainability matter

### Scale-stage
- Cost efficiency matters
- Operational complexity matters
- Team velocity matters more than novelty

The same tech stack is rarely ideal for every stage.

## When Next.js Is the Right Choice (And When It’s Not)

I use Next.js often — **but not blindly**.

### Next.js works best when:
- SEO is important
- You need server + client flexibility
- You want a single unified web platform
- You’re building a long-term product

### I avoid or reconsider Next.js when:
- The app is purely internal
- SEO has zero value
- The product is a short-lived experiment
- The complexity outweighs the benefits

No framework is “always correct.”

## When I Reject Client Requests

This is where trust matters.

I push back when:

- A tool is chosen only because it’s trending
- A stack adds complexity without real benefit
- A request increases long-term cost for short-term gain
- A decision will make hiring or scaling harder later

Saying “yes” to everything is easy.  
Saying “no” when it matters is what protects the product.

---

## Long-Term Cost vs Short-Term Speed

Fast delivery is important.  
But **fast mistakes are expensive**.

Every tech decision has hidden costs:
- Maintenance
- Hiring
- Infrastructure
- Refactoring
- Onboarding

My goal is to balance:
- Shipping quickly **now**
- Staying flexible **later**

That balance is where good products survive.

---

## The Result of This Approach

This way of working leads to:

- Fewer rewrites
- Lower long-term cost
- Easier team scaling
- More predictable delivery
- Stronger trust with founders

It also filters out projects that aren’t ready to be built properly — which is intentional.

---

## Final Thoughts

I don’t build projects to show off tools.  
I build them to **last**.

Technology is a means, not an identity.

If you want a partner who:
- Questions assumptions
- Chooses tools responsibly
- Pushes back when needed
- Thinks beyond the first release

Then this is how I work.
